    comment: Anthony has excelled in his first year with State Farm, particularly with the competency expectations I have of a new employee and developer. I appreciate his ability to work with new developers on the team, his ability to dig in and learn, experiment, and try his best at new technical challenges. He was able to show his early leadership of the dev group and really surprised our program partners with his thoroughness and attention to detail.
