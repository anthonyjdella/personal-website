  ## Get to Know Me

  There's a story behind the person. Failing multiple times, but rising up and overcoming challenges.

  ### I develop and design cool things.

  I love to work with software because it has unlimited possibilities. Having the ability to create anything is really fun and rewarding. I love to solve problems and learn new things, this quality is so important in tech.
  
  I also believe it's important to present your technical solutions in a beautiful and intuitive package. When I'm not working in front of my computer, you can find me traveling, watching basketball, being a foodie, or taking photos.
