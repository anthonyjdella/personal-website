  ### I develop and design cool things.

  I've always introduced myself as a developer, designer, and lover of tech. I am those things, but also much more. Iâ€™m more than a limited character count and a filtered photo to be found in the void of social media.


  Iâ€™m a digital creator, an artist, a problem solver, a creative, a designer, an illustrator, a presentation guru, a storyteller, a listener, a photographer, a teacher, and a lifetime student. Iâ€™m an environmentalist. A mental health advocate. I support equal rights and income equality. I believe in reducing consumerism, globalization, and our carbon footprint. Iâ€™m a Texan with anti-Texas views. I believe in living in the present moment.


  I am Taiwanese/Italian and proud of my ethnicity. Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ is my second home.


  I have a passion for traveling and seeing all parts of the world. I like watching basketball and combat sports. I love food, you can always find me at restaurants around town. I like trying new things but I'm risk averse.


  There's still more to me than these things. Contact me to know more.
