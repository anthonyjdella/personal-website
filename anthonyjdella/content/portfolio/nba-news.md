F5 Season is an NBA meme that means fans are constantly refreshing their news feeds to learn about breaking news. 

    > F5 on your keyboard is the refresh button.

I built an app that sends you NBA news whenever you text "F5" to your Twilio phone number. Why? Well, during the NBA offseason, fans want to have up-to-date info about recent trades or trade requests.

I also wrote a tutorial, so you can build this app yourself. Check it out on [Twilio's Blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/get-the-latest-nba-news-sent-to-your-phone-via-sms).
