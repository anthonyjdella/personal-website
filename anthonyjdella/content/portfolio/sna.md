OTP (One-Time Password) methods validate user authentication but the user experience is compromised. Users are sent a password which they then must enter to verify their identity. With [SNA](https://www.twilio.com/blog/silent-network-authentication-sna-overview), the verification happens in the background for a seamless user experience.
