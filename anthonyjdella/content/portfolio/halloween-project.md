It's Halloween! Want to scare your friends and family with a fun app?

If you're familiar with Scream, a famous movie from 1996, there's a famous scene where a killer calls a victim. Watch it here:

I wanted to re-create this scene using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com), so I built it with Twilio Studio, a low-code tool from Twilio.

If you want to try it out, text anything to **(940) 394-8137**

I also wrote a tutorial, so you can build this app yourself. Check it out on [Twilio's Blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/do-you-like-scary-movies-build-a-halloween-project-with-twilio).
