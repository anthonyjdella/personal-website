title: JSON Resume
date: 2021-10-20T12:49:27.000+06:00
thumbnail: ../images/portfolio/
service: API, Javascript, Firebase, CI/CD
client: Myself
shortDescription: I reversed engineered the JSON Resume Registry project so that it works on my privately hosted Firebase domain.
challenge: JSON Resume uses their own domain (e.g. http://registry.jsonresume.org/anthonyjdella). In order to use it, you have to use their own 'jsonresume' domain. 
solution: I didn't want to have to use their domain, so I reverse engineered their project to host it on resume.anthonydellavecchia.com
