If you've been a company sponsor at a tech conference, you'd know that attracting attendees is difficult.
This project solves that issue, because attendees can interact with a video game while also learning about Twilio products & offerings.

[TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest) is Twilio's educational video game. Within the game, you can add your own custom extensions to it. I forked a version of Nathaniel's, another Twilio Developer Evangelist, and added multiple features/improvements to it.

Check out a demo of it from this Youtube video:
