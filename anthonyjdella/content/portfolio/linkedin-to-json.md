title: LinkedIn to JSON Chrome Extension
date: 2021-10-10T12:49:27.000+06:00

service: Chrome Extension, Javascript, JSON
client: Myself
shortDescription: I updated an existing Chrome Extension which scrapes data from your LinkedIn profile and exports it into JSON, which can be used with my the JSON Resume standard.
challenge: JSON Resume is a standardized JSON-based resume. Someone created an open-source Chrome Extension that looks at your LinkedIn profile and exports the data into JSON. However, this tool was not updated with the most recent JSON Resume Schema, and also did not work with my customized schema.
solution: Since I created my own JSON Resume schema, I wanted it to work with this tool. So, I added functionality to use my custom schema, as well as v1 of the JSON Resume project.
