I always enjoy learning new technologies and creating projects. This website ([linked here](https://roadmap.anthonydellavecchia.com/)) was created in just a few days as a way to showcase my ability to quickly learn new skills, as well as showcase my technical content creation. Here were my goals:

1. Create a website with React and Next.js
2. Write a Blog post (for beginners) to help others understand APIs
3. Create interactive animations and supplement them with my blog post
4. Curate a list of my favorite blog posts
5. Create a Dev Rel roadmap to plan my future goals
6. Document my thought process and design

My favorite features are:

1. The interactive animations I was able to create
2. The interactive Kanban board I was able to implement
3. The fun confetti animation I was able to implement
