## I got a job at Twilio!

I joined [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), an awesome tech company headquarted in the Bay. This is my first time breaking into tech and I'm so grateful.
I'm joining as a Staff level Developer Evangelist.

- [Check out my official intro on Twilio's blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/introducing-twilio-developer-evangelist-anthony-dellavecchia)


What is a Developer Evangelist? Well, the answer varies based on who you ask but my main goal is to inspire and empower software developers around the world.

I'll travel around the US to different tech events and give live coding workshops and tech talks. I'll make videos and tutorials on how to build cool software. I'll serve thousands of developers across the world.

With this new job, I'll be moving to Seattle, Washington. And since Twilio is 100% remote, I may travel around before settling down in one location.
