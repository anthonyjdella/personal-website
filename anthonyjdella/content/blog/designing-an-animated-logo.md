> **TLDR:** I make an animated logo (think of a .GIF) and explain how you can make one too.

Having an online personal brand is ever so important. Part of this includes having a unified profile picture and logo. You can take this to another level by animating the logo!

Although I have experience with design tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere I have never worked with animation. I found a website called [SVGator](https://www.svgator.com/) which animates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The free version has many limitations but I was able to use it to create my animated logo.

1. Start by creating an account with SVGator and making a new project.
2. Design your logo with the pen and shape tools. This part requires some previous experience since you'll need to design the static image.

3. Make sure to organize your canvas so that you can easily transform and animate the SVG.

4. Add animations based on a timeline. To make an image move from point A to point B, you will need to position the image, move the timeline, and re-position the image. Check out how complex the timeline is for this logo:

That was just the framework for creating an animated logo. Obviously, a lot of personal creativity will have to be used, since you need to design a logo and then think of how you want to animate it. But hopefully this helps point you in the right direction!

I got inspiration for the logo design from [GitHub user vaaski](https://github.com/vaaski).
