> **TLDR:** This is a tutorial on how to build a Python app that will summarize text that you take from images.

---

## Overview

Content, content, content! There's too much content out there and too much to read. Don't you wish you could pull out your phone -> take a picture of a book -> get texted a summary of what it says?

I built a Python app that does just this, and I'll teach you how you can build it too.

Here's a gif of using it in action:
