> **TLDR:** A bit more details about APIs ([part 1 here](https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/what-are-apis/)) using an easy-to-understand analogy.

## Recap

In my [previous article](https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/what-are-apis/), I explain what an API is (without any code). Let's recap what that article mentions.

* Think of an API as a customer ordering food at a restaruant
    * The customer makes a request (with their order) to a waiter
    * The waiter brings that request to the kitchen
    * The kitchen/chef makes the food
    * The waiter delivers the order back to a (happy) customer

I also broke this concept down into a few extra steps. Let's take a look at them again:

- Step 1: Recognize that you are hungry and would like some food.
- Step 2: Go to a restaurant that serves what you're looking for.
- Step 3: Browse the menu.
- Step 4: Decide what you would like to order.
- Step 5: Speak with a waiter and make your request.
- Step 6: Wait a little while, and eventually your waiter will bring you your order.

I'll talk about each of these in more detail, in the subsequent sections. And yes, I love using food üçî analogies because who doesn't like food?!

## Step 1: Recognize that you are hungry and would like some food 

Before you order food, you need to recognize that you are hungry and want to eat! I mean, who goes to a restaurant when they're not hungry?

In terms of APIs, that same principle applies. As a software developer, you need to recognize that you could use an API when you need it.

So how do you know when to use an API?

Unfortunately, there's no equivalent of your stomach growling in software development. But a good question to ask yourself is this: is what I'm trying to do, already available? If the answer is yes, you can bet that there's already an API for it.

Alright, now that you know you are hungry, you
