### TLDR: Set up Gmail forwarding so it looks like your email address matches your domain name.

Want to organize your email inbox?

How about exposing a different email address for different purposes?

I set up email forwarding so that I can receive emails to my existing Gmail inboxes, but use different email address names.

For example, these are my different email addresses:

1. hello@anthonydellavecchia.com - general things
2. dev@anthonydellavecchia.com - software development
3. hireme@anthonydellavecchia.com - job seeking
4. photo@anthonydellavecchia.com - photography
5. design@anthonydellavecchia.com - design

### What's the Point?

Everything is 
* Organized
* Routed
* Exposed to the respective audience! 


### Use Cases

So, if I have a photography job, I can tell my client to email me at photo@anthonydellavecchia.com, or if I'm looking for a job, I can ask companies to email me at hireme@anthonydellavecchia.com. Then, those emails are nicely organized in Gmail.


## How to Set it Up

First thing is to have a domain with a domain registrar such as Namecheap, Google Domains, HostGator, GoDaddy, etc (I recommend Google Domains). This post won't go over instructions to set that up, so you may want to Google that first.

Next, you will want to enable Email Forwarding from your Domain registrar settings. I use Namecheap, so this image is from Namecheap, but a similar process will apply if you're using a different registrar.

After that, you will want to redirect emails from an Alias to an existing email address.

As you can see, anthonyjdella.photo@gmail.com is an existing email address that I have with Gmail. I want emails sent to photo@anthonydellavecchia.com to be forwarded to anthonyjdella.photo@gmail.com.


Next, log into your existing Gmail account, in this example it's anthonyjdella.photo@gmail.com.

1. Go to Manage Google Account -> Security tab
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Add an App Password

### Step 1

- Click on `Manage Your Google Account`

### Step 3

- Select `Mail` as the App
- Select `Other (custom name)` as the Device
- Enter your desired email address (i.e. photo@anthonydellavecchia.com) or the email which you want to expose
